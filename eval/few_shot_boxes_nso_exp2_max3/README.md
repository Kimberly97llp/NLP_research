# Base split (zero-/few-shot)

This is the dataset used for the zero-shot/few-shot experiments (see Section 4 of the paper). For these experiments, we only used the test data. `test-subsample-states-t5.jsonl` contains the subsample of the test data that was used for the follow-up experiments.

`prompt_incontext.txt` and `prompt_incontext_altform.txt` contain the prompt templates for the few-shot experiments.

`prompt_zeroshot.txt` contains the prompt template for the zero-shot experiment.
