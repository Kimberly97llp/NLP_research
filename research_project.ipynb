Write $8!$ as $8\\\\cdot 7 \\\\cdot 6 \\\\cdot 5\\\\cdot 4\\\\cdot 3\\\\cdot 2$.  Observe that $30^3<8!<40^3$, so the cube root of $8!$ is between $30$ and $40$.  With this in mind, we group $7$ and $5$ to make one factor of $35$.  We can also make a factor of $36$ by using $6$ along with $3$ and $2$.  This leaves $8$ and $4$ which multiply to give $32$.  The assignment $(a,b,c)=(32,35,36)$ has the minimum value of $c-a$, since $31$, $33$, $34$, $37$, $38$, and $39$ contain prime factors not present in $8!$.
